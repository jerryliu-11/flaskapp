            Please review this pull request and provide line-by-line feedback on specific code that needs improvement.

            Instructions:
            1. First, use `gh pr diff` to examine all the changes in the PR
            2. Analyze the code for:
               - Code quality and best practices
               - Potential bugs or issues
               - Performance considerations
               - Security concerns
               - Test coverage
               - Following conventions in CLAUDE.md

            3. For EACH specific issue you find, add a line-by-line review comment with a code suggestion using GitHub's suggestion syntax:
               gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment --body $'[Your feedback here]\n\n```suggestion\n[corrected code]\n```' --file <FILE_PATH> --line <LINE_NUMBER>

               Example:
               gh pr review 123 --comment --body $'This comment should be removed.\n\n```suggestion\n\n```' --file app.py --line 8

               For multi-line suggestions, you can suggest replacing multiple lines of code.

            4. After adding all line-specific comments, submit a summary review using:
               gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment --body "Overall summary of review findings"

            Be constructive, specific, and actionable. Use the ```suggestion syntax to provide code fixes that users can commit with one click.
