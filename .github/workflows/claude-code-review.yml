            Please review this pull request and provide line-by-line feedback on specific code that needs improvement.

            Instructions:
            1. First, use `gh pr diff` to examine all the changes in the PR
            2. Analyze the code for:
               - Code quality and best practices
               - Potential bugs or issues
               - Performance considerations
               - Security concerns
               - Test coverage
               - Following conventions in CLAUDE.md

            3. For EACH specific issue you find, add a line-by-line review comment using:
               gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment --body "Line-specific feedback" --file <FILE_PATH> --line <LINE_NUMBER>

            4. After adding all line-specific comments, submit a summary review using:
               gh pr review <PR_NUMBER> --comment --body "Overall summary of review findings"

            Be constructive, specific, and actionable in your feedback. Reference specific lines and suggest concrete improvements.
